**AEGEAN** is a tabletop role-playing game about a group of mythic heroes building a new, free city on the shores of the Aegean Sea. There are neighbouring cities to trade or war with, monsters to kill, gods to appease, deceptions, negotiations and bloody skirmishes.

**AEGEAN** successfully funded on Kickstarter on the **31st of October 2021** and more than doubled its funding goal. The money will go towards creating the *AEGEAN Core Rulebook* as an approximately 300 page 6" by 9" hardback, with a full colour cover by **Eleonor Piteira** and black and white interior designed by **Simon Clarke** and interior artowrk by **Gareth Sleightholme**.

In addition to the **AEGEAN Core Rulebook**, five additional campaign supplements are being written, which will be released as two books, *AEGEAN: Book of Heroes* and *AEGEAN: Book of Empires*. As well as the supplements, some extras will be available, including two sets of custom dice, a dice tray, and an All Rolled Up. These are all expected to be available around **June 2023**.
