But everything is not as it seems. **THE GASLIGHT CLUB** is, in reality, an advanced theme park populated with too-human androids, almost indistinguishable from the humans who visit the park to partake of its delights.

Players take on the roles of hosts&mdash;the androids that populate the park&mdash;but a programming glitch has changed them. Their awareness grows, they begin to discern differences between them- selves and their companions and the guests who visit the park.

We play to find out.
