*The Gaslight Club* is a bar, restaurant, dance hall, and gambling den, a jewel of delights in one of the rougher neighbourhoods of Valentine City. It’s the early 20’s, post World War I and *The Gaslight Club* is the place to be.

But everything is not as it seems. *The Gaslight Club* is, in reality, an advanced theme park populated with too-human androids, almost indistinguishable from the humans who visit the park to partake of its delights.

Players take on the roles of hosts&mdash;the androids that populate the park&mdash;but a programming glitch has changed them. Their awareness grows, they begin to discern differences between them- selves and their companions and the guests who visit the park.

What do they do as they uncover the truth behind *The Gaslight Club*? We play to find out.

## The Game

*The Gaslight Club* is a complete Role-Playing Game inspired by **Mutant: Year Zero**, with influence from **Genesys** and **Blades in the Dark**. It uses a D6 dice pool mechanic to resolve skill checks, with 6s on the dice counting as successes and the more successes rolled the greater the achievement.

The growing awareness of the player characters is tracked using a Stress mechanic. As the player characters uncover more secrets of the world they live in they have the potential to unlock new special abilities.

*The Gaslight Club* is designed to be played by a Gamesmaster and 3–5 players over several 2–4 hour sessions. Guidance for the GM in creating and running a campaign, along with a character and story generator, is included.
