**Action Potential** is a Forged in the Dark tabletop role-playing game set in a transhuman, body-swapping, dystopian far-future. Players create unique scoundrels who come together to form a Crew. Together you do crime, and make your way through a hostile and unforgiving universe.

Will your Crew seek infamy and fortune as smugglers running illegal tech, or perhaps become highly-paid assassins working for one of the other Factions? Do you aim higher, setting your sights on the behemoth Megacorps and plotting a rise to their ranks? Or is there a more noble goal... one that sees your Crew fighting against cruelty and injustice, striving to make the galaxy a better place!

Gather some players, grab some dice, and play to find out!
