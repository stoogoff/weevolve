You take on the role of a new recruit at ClarIT, learning the basics of the dreamshare technology by diving into a training simulation of Carter Hendersonâ€™s attempt to communicate with his comatose daughter. However, the environment is defined randomly, meaning every dive into this simulation will be different.
