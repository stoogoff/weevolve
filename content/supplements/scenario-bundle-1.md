This bundle contains two stand-alone scenarios for **Action Potential**. Gather some friends for one-off sessions, or link these into your ongoing campaign. Each document gives you information on the Score, as well as vivid descriptions of new locations, and NPCs with clear personal motivation. Plenty of hooks to get your players stuck into the story! 

In "The Juggernaut" the Crew are hired by a black market food dealer to liberate some crates of fresh produce. Surely a straightforward undertaking, with an easy payout! What could possibly go wrong...

In "Trouble at the Nexus" the Crew are hired to resolve a dangerous hostage situation. With half a million Personas in danger, can the Crew neutralise the threat and prevent negative publicity for the theme park?
