*Enemy of the Hearth* is a scenario for King Arthur Pendragon. It's composed of many incidental scenes which are designed to be interspersed into other adventures while the player-knights are at their lord's court. Friends and neighbours are introduced and intrigue flourishes over the years. As the scenario progresses, accusations are made and honour is questioned. It is up to the player-knights to uncover the traitor at court and find proof of his wrongdoing.
