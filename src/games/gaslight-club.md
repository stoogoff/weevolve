**The Gaslight Club** is a bar, restaurant, dance hall, and gambling den, a jewel of delights in one of the rougher neighbourhoods of Valentine City. It’s the early 20’s, post World War I and **the Gaslight Club** is the place to be.

But everything is not as it seems. **The Gaslight Club** is, in reality, an advanced theme park populated with too-human androids, almost indistinguishable from the humans who visit the park to partake of its delights.

Players take on the roles of hosts&mdash;the androids that populate the park&mdash;but a programming glitch has changed them. Their awareness grows, they begin to discern differences between them- selves and their companions and the guests who visit the park.

What do they do as they uncover the truth behind **the Gaslight Club**?
